Startup links, new method

As we support a complete root filesystem inside each 
package, you're able to place your own startup scripts 
in PACKAGENAME/etc/init.d and place symbolic links to 
/etc/rc*.d as usual.

Startup links, old method 
(DEPRECATED, just for leagacy support)

please place your scripts in

triggered during startup.If you don't use these method, 
feel free to delete this folders.
